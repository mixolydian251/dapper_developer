            My name is Jordan Hensley. I am currently a freelance web developer and problem-solver in Raleigh, NC.
            I moved to the area in 2016 for school, looking for a career path that was right for me.
            After a few semesters into an engineering degree, I took a C++ class that caught my attention.
            A few months later I was introduced to Python which was a game changer for me. I ended up building
            a small game in python featuring my dog, Chase, that I wanted to share with my friends. I remember
            thinking "Man, I wish I could just send people a link, then they could play on any device". Like an
            eagle in the sunset, In swoops Javascript (this is where I fell in love). I quickly began building
            apps, attending Meet-ups, and religiously checking Medium and Hacker News for the latest and greatest
            tips and tricks. I fell in love with the code and haven't looked back since.
